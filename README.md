# Island_mammals

Scrips to run the analyses for the paper:

Rozzi et al. Dwarfism and gigantism drive human-mediated extinctions on islands.

All data are available at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6444335.v2

Scripts from 001 until 005 fit GLMMs and run sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of extant insular populations and species which have not experienced any relevant change in body size. Scripts from 008 until 011 fit PLRs and run sensitivity analyses to account for phylogenetic uncertainty (species-level and population-level), data uncertainty and their interaction (population-level). We also tested for phylogenetic signal in the magnitude and direction of body size change and plotted the direction of body size change on the mammal tree of life (007_Plot_phylo_traits.R). Scripts 006 and 014 create maps with location of fossil occurrences and extinctions of dwarfs and giants by geological epoch. Scripts 012 and 013 create plots of the results of PyRate analyses and sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of old and intermediate representatives of anagenetic lineages and indirect dates associated with Malagasy fossil occurrences. Scripts 015 and 016 create plots of the results of MTET analyses and associated sensitivity analyses. All scripts are commented.
